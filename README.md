logback-request-ui
==================

Renderer for [logback-request](https://github.com/wvuong/logback-request) in AngularJS.  Logback-request has Servlet filters that inject the current request's log messages as JSON into the HTML response.  This Angular component reads the JSON and renders it into a table at the bottom of the HTML document.
